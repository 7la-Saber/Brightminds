            A sleep disorder is a condition that affects the ability to sleep 
            well on a regular basis. These disorders can disrupt the quality, 
            timing, and duration of sleep, leading to daytime impairment 
            and other health issues. Common types of sleep disorders include: 
            Insomnia: Difficulty falling or staying asleep. 
            Sleep Apnea: Breathing interruptions during sleep, often resulting 
            in loud snoring and daytime fatigue. 
            Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS): An uncontrollable urge to move 
            the legs, often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations. 
            Narcolepsy: Excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden sleep 
            attacks. 
            Parasomnias: Abnormal behaviors during sleep, such as 
            sleepwalking or night terrors. 
            Sleep disorders can be caused by a variety of factors, including 
            stress, medical conditions, medications, and lifestyle choices. 
            Treatment options may involve lifestyle changes, therapy, or 
            medication. If you suspect you have a sleep disorder, it's 
            important to consult a healthcare professional for proper 
            diagnosis and management
