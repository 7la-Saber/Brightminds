            <h1>Social Media and Mental health</h1>
            <pre>
            In a world that is connected 24/7, where every update can make a difference, 
            social media is the axis around which much of our lives revolve. From the moment we wake up until the moment we
            die, we are surrounded by its influences, interacting with it in ways that we could not have imagined just
            a few years ago. Information flows nonstop, but while we enjoy instant connectivity and instant news, there
            is another side to these networks that can be invisible but hugely influential. In this exploratory journey, we
            will explore how social media shapes our world, uncover influences we may not realize, and explore how to balance
            its benefits and challenges. Are you ready to discover the other side of this digital age?
            Social media is also a common source of stress for its users. A survey performed on 7,000 mothers found that 42% of mothers using the photo-sharing 
            site Pinterest
             reported occasionally suffering from 'Pinterest Stress.'
            Obviously, social media can cause depression and anxiety, but how? It happens in two ways.
            First, chronic stress from constantly being alert for new social media messages affects your instinctive fight-or-flight limbic system.
            This constant state of alert is similar to being on continuous lookout for predators, causing a release of the stress hormone cortisol.
            The second way social media causes depression and anxiety is through the stress produced from trying to project an unrealistic 
            and unachievable perception of perfection within your social network. The social anxiety associated with trying to maintain a 
            perfect self-image at all times—whether it's a perfect career, marriage, or life—leads to constant stress and, in turn, the 
            continuous release of cortisol. Over time, the constant release of cortisol from heavy social media usage can cause damage to
            your gastrointestinal tract (gut), triggering an immuno-inflammatory response in the body and brain, ultimately leading to depression and 
            anxiety  When people focus so much time on social media networks that real life relationships
            begin to suffer. In doing this our more important relationships with our loved ones and close
            family members suffer because more of our time and effort is put into the illusion of social
            media. MTV’s show, Catfish based off a documentary film, is a good example showcasing
            the
            illusion of social media connections. The term Catfish describes people who create fake
            social
            networking profiles, and "catfishing" is the process of befriending strangers online while
            using a
            fake or stolen identity. It is a deceptive act and it has ruined marriages, relationships and the
            emotional well being of many people.
            In one of the episodes on Catfish, the narrator of the current television show, Nev
            Schulman, went to meet his online love in person only to be shocked by the deception he
            discovered. The woman whose picture he had seen on social media was that of an entirely
            different person. In Nev’s mind if she could lie about something so basic as her appearance
            her
            whole character as a whole was called into question,After conversing with her he found that
            many other of her personal details of her life were false as well. He was heartbroken to find
            he
            had really fallen for no more than a perfectly, constructed mirage. While it may initially sound
            trivial, if not superficial, the personal implications of such an occurrence are truly profound.
            In “Psychology Today 2012”, Auzeen Saedi a Ph.D said “the near anonymity of online
            interactions made many impossible things in the real world, possible in the virtual one.”
            The mind has a powerful way of weaving intricate narratives about reality when in love.
            Study
            findings indicate when shown pictures of their beloved, individuals have better pain
            tolerance.
            Hence, one can start to understand the strong attachment that can form from thousands of
            miles away through the exchange of repeated sentiments and promises of lifelong love with
            no more
            than a photo in hand.
            An additional insight of catfish, noted by Pauline Wiessner, PhD, a University of Utah
            anthropologist who studies social networks, says Anonymity also allows darker impulses to
            flourish. In one tragic case, 13-year-old Megan Meier hanged herself after being cyber
            bullied on
            Social media by Josh Evans—not a real boy, it turned out, but a false profile created by her
            adult
            neighbor. many of us are looking for relationships, and believe we may find it in the
            most unlikely of places, such as social media, will leave us disappointed. Thus in this pursuit,
           staying vigilant and grounded in reality is paramount.
            The personal costs of excessive social media usage are high, leaving one open to anxiety,
            depression, stress and false connections. Due to the intensity of the online world, which
            requires
            constant engagement, users experience factor of self-awareness that usually triggers
            depression.
            In addition social media promotes the projection of a perfect self, which leads to depression
            anxiety. Social media promotes superficial connections that can end up causing long-term
            emotional and psychological problems. Social media also fosters false intimacy both
            intentionally false and unintentionally false, as seen in the selfie photo and catfish examples.
            Without acknowledging these negative personal impacts of social media, the harms, both
            psychological and emotional will continue to grow. 
            Stress as a Reactive Mechanism
            Stress is a reactive mechanism that has developed in humans as a survival tool, allowing us
             to make quick decisions when facing immediate threats. However, experiencing long-term stress can lead
              to chronic physical and mental illnesses. To understand how social media affects stress, it is essential
               to first comprehend what stress entails.
            
            Stress, similar to anxiety, is something most people will experience at multiple stages in
             their lives. Baum (1990) defines stress as an emotional experience accompanied by predictable 
             biochemical, physiological, and behavioral changes. These physiological changes can be triggered by 
             the use of social media, and several theories explain why social media may cause stress.
            One key theory is the "highlight reel effect" seen on friends' Facebook pages. When viewing a 
            friend's posts, people often only see the best moments in their lives, which can create pressure to
             do more or buy nicer things, like a new car, leading to feelings of inadequacy.
            Another theory involves the pressure to portray the "ideal self." This pressure may be conscious
             or unconscious, but it can push individuals to follow the latest trends in music, fashion, cars,
            and even homes. Keeping up with these trends can also cause financial strain, adding further
             stress.
            
            In a two-part study conducted by Duggan & Ellison (2014) on social comparisons made on Facebook,
            the researchers examined the correlation between this phenomenon and depression. The study found
            strong evidence supporting the notion that social media negatively impacts users' emotional 
            states, particularly after extended periods of being logged in. Many users reported feeling bad 
            about themselves after comparing their lives to others' on Facebook.
            Another concern related to social media and stress is how engaging with social media at bedtime 
            can lead to staying up later than usual. The "blue light" emitted from laptop and smartphone 
            screens disrupts sleep patterns, leading to less sleep. Mink et al. (2012) conducted a study 
            examining the effects of sleep deprivation on stress levels and found that those who had less 
            sleep experienced higher levels of stress compared to those who had a healthy amount of sleep. 
            This may be another contributing factor to how social media affects stress levels.
