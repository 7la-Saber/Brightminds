            <h1>More About Stress</h1>
            <p>
                Stress is the body’s reaction to feeling threatened or under pressure. It can be triggered
                by various situations, such as work, academic pressure, financial issues, or major life
                changes. When you perceive a threat or a high-pressure situation, your body releases
                hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, preparing you for a “fight or flight” response.
            </p>
